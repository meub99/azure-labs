Modern cloud apps hackathon
Overview
The Modern cloud apps Hackathon is a hands-on exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure App Services and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, security, and scale using various components of Microsoft Azure. The Hackathon can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the Hackathon to model a real world experience much closer and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.
